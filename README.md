# LoanJump
Alpha-build for a fun, stressful, decision-based college simulator

1.	Game Synopsis
LoanJump is a game about just trying to make it through college. Players are given a series of choices that allow them to allocate their time and priorities throughout their college journey. Players are managing Money, Health, and GPA, while also allocating a certain number of hours per month, towards the eventual end goal of graduation. Over the course of the gameplay, players are given the chance to sleep, study, socialize, and seek out ways to make money. Depending on where these attributes may fall by the end of the playthrough, players may be advised into taking a medical leave, forced to drop out due to lack of money, or will graduate successfully – and left to evaluate how much their degree was worth it. Student loans are also regularly available to the player – if funds ever get too low, loans will essentially become necessary.


2.	Game Motivations and Mechanics
•	Choices – The micro loop of the game is decision-making. When presented with prompts on how to spend their time or allocate their priorities in the current college session, players will answer either Yes or No. They’ll be given hints on how their decisions may affect them later on.
o	Gamer Motivations: Strategy – Players are given instant feedback on how their choices (or lack thereof) affect their attributes. As such, it will be important to try and choose wisely. There may be instances where a choice could positively boost one attribute while negatively impacting another, further promoting strategy by adding an element of give-and-take.	
•	Resource Management – The core gameplay loop is the management of three visible attributes (Money, Health, GPA, and Loans), and a hidden fifth attribute (amount of hours able to be spent in any given moment)
o	Gamer Motivations: Completion, Challenge
•	Race Against Time – Players have only 5 seconds to make each decision. Failure to choose in 5 seconds or less will result in each of the attributes taking a negative hit.
o	Gamer Motivations: Challenge – The timer adds a challenge to the micro and core loops. Players may not always have time to think their decisions through as much as they’d like, and making a hasty decision could lead to negative consequences down the road.
•	Progression Towards an End State – Eventually, the player’s choices will lead them to one of three end states: either of two fail states (not being able to pay for further schooling, being advised to medical leave), or a win state (graduation).
o	Gamer Motivations: Completion, Strategy - These end states are reflective of the player’s choices and prioritization along the course of their playthrough. This leads to an overall need to strategize choices and attribute management over a longer time scale than just the five-second decision window.

4.	Design Evolution
The biggest change to LoanShark, by far, was the choice to make the game text-based. Originally designed as a platformer (wherein successive platforms prompted the series of choices), I decided to put the platforming elements on pause for the scope of this project. While part of me was hoping to be able to come back to these platforming elements and implement them if I had the time, I knew I was ultimately much more focused on the actual gameplay systems. Focusing on the backend led me to make the game text-based (and even this format still necessitated some trial-and-error with assets, sprites, and cosmetics).

The playmaking sessions encouraged me to re-examine the role of hidden information in this game. While the effects of the choices on each attribute were originally hidden, I was prompted to allow for hints at each potential attribute change by including the mouse-over mechanic. This allowed me to change and extend the role of strategy in this game. In initial playtests, the strategic aspects seemed to be more retrospective than in-the-moment for many players. Allowing for hints allows players to be more strategic as they go along.

 
5.	Reflection
•	The main thing I’m proud of with LoanShark is the system of attribute management and interaction that comprises the game’s backend. It was so much fun to create a system of hasty choice making and strategic give-and-take, and really brainstorm different ways to have these attributes interact with one another. My system grew over time across many iterations, playtesting sessions, and feedback.
•	The other thing I’m proud of with this game, is the emotional feedback it generates. Across playtesting, I’ve been told a range of emotional feedback – some have joked the game is “too real,” while others have suggested it’s fun and even relish how angry the game might make them. In any case, being able to make players angry, annoyed, upset, excited, or content with a game that I made, is pretty much the dream scenario. What’s more, is that no matter the emotional response, LoanJump seems to make people want to play again. I’ve always viewed being able to generate an emotional response (in any direction) as one of the absolute best things a game designer could ever hope to achieve. The fact that I’ve also achieved a certain level of replay value, is another dream scenario. So happy my game was well received in this way, even in its current iteration, and hopefully I can get to improve upon it even further!
